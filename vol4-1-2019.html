					<strong>Abstract</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Rationale of Study</em>
					-Savings and Credit Cooperative (SACCO) movement in Kenya plays a critical role in national development by eradicating poverty amongst citizens. However, the SACCO sector faces numerous challenges which include weak and non-standard processes, shifting markets, rapid product obsolescence, hyper-competition and financial upheavals. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of knowledge management as a strategy for achieving competitive advantage among SACCOs in Nairobi City County in Kenya.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Methodology</em>
					-The study was informed by ‘Knowledge-based theory of the firm’ published by Carla Curado in 1959. The theory states that knowledge is the most strategically-significant resource in a firm. Qualitative method was employed in gathering data from three purposively selected SACCOs in Nairobi City County. Purposive sampling was further used to select heads of key departments, records officers, and ICT personnel as respondents in the study. Data was collected through unstructured interviews. The data was analyzed thematically. 
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Findings</em>
					-The study revealed that SACCOs lack structured approaches to manage knowledge. The study concludes that the haphazard knowledge management practices cannot be equated to good knowledge management practices and cannot give SACCOs a competitive advantage. The study also revealed that negative personality traits, unhealthy competition, and lack of mutual trust amongst staff hindered effective knowledge management. It also emerged that operational factors like lack of resources, lack of top management support, and demanding work schedules also affected the ability of staff to share knowledge. 
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4"> 
					<em>Implications</em>
					-The findings of this study may benefit SACCOs seeking to understand and manage their unique knowledge to remain competitive.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Originality</em>
					-This is an original and empirical study on a subject which is less explored especially in Kenya.

					Students’ Perceived Areas of Difficulty during Library Practicum in Nigerian University Libraries

					<strong>Abstract</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Rationale of Study</em>
					-The practicum scheme is a scheduled, run, and evaluated programme. The programme provides opportunity for students to incorporate and apply classroom learning in library and information science in the workplace environment thereby enabling them to learn from experts. The study investigated students’ perceived areas of difficulty during library practicum in Delta State and Prof. Aghagbo Nwako university libraries in Nigeria. It investigated students’ areas of learning difficulties during library practicum; teaching difficulties encountered by library supervisors during library practicum; and the relationship between the students’ and supervisors’ learning and teaching difficulties during library practicum.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Methodology</em>
					-This was a descriptive research using a questionnaire for data gathering. The population of the study consisted of all 154 final year students (2017/2018 session) of the Department of Library and Information Science in the two universities studied. The population also included 30 supervisors of the practicum. Data was analysed through descriptive statistics.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Findings</em>
					-The study revealed that the use of classification schemes, filing of catalogue cards, indexing and abstracting of materials, descriptive cataloguing and use of computers were the areas of learning and teaching difficulties experienced by the students and supervisors. Suggestions were made and it was concluded that library authorities should see to it that teaching materials are made available to the students on practicum because the exercise is undertaken just once in the students’ academic life time before proceeding to the world of work. 
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Implications</em>
					-The findings of this study may be useful for identifying the different learning and teaching difficulties of students and industry-based supervisors with a view to proffering solutions to the identified lapses.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Originality</em>
					-This is an original and empirical study on library practicum in two universities in Nigeria.
