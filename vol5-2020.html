					<strong>Abstract</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Rationale of Study</em>
					-This study examined entrepreneurship development in university libraries with a focus on reskilling, opportunities and challenges for library and information science practitioners in the South-South Zone of Nigeria.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Methodology</em>
					-The study adopted the survey research design. Five research questions were postulated and one hypothesis formulated to find out the relationship between the professional characteristics of library and information science (LIS) practitioners and their perception towards entrepreneurship development. The population of the study was 150 LIS professionals drawn from all the government owned universities in the South-South Zone of Nigeria. Data was collected using a questionnaire and analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. 
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Findings</em>
					-The findings show that LIS practitioners in the South-South Zone of Nigeria have a low perception towards entrepreneurship development even though they have the right skills needed for entrepreneurship. The benefits derived from entrepreneurship include control and flexibility of own time, among others. The study therefore concluded that no significant relationship exists between LIS practitioners’ professional characteristics and their perception towards entrepreneurship development.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4"> 
					<em>Implications</em>
					-Based on the findings, the researchers recommend that LIS schools and professional associations should organise sensitisation or orientation programmes on entrepreneurship development in order to re-write the perception of library staff towards entrepreneurship.
				</p>

					<em>Originality</em>

					<strong>Abstract</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Rationale of Study</em>
					-This paper investigated provision of digital reference services in selected Nigerian state university libraries. The study examined how digital reference service can improve information service delivery to library users in Nigerian university libraries.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Methodology</em>
					-A survey research method was adopted for the study. The population of the study comprised of 45 professional librarians from three university libraries. These are Delta State University Library, Abraka; Niger Delta University Library, Amasoma; and River State University of Technology library, Port Harcourt. The population of librarians in the three institutions was small. So, the whole population formed the sample size and was used for the study. A questionnaire was used to collect data for the study. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. 
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Findings</em>
					-The study revealed that digital reference services offered in the university libraries include instructions, guidance, information and research assistance and consultation to library users. Social media like Facebook and Twitter, text-based chats, email correspondences, live chat and telephone communication are all channels through which digital reference services are delivered in the state university libraries studied. Effects of digital reference services on university libraries include increased patrons’ interactions, speed of service delivery to users and accessibility of information services. Challenges faced in the provision of digital reference services were low bandwidth in remote areas, hitches in downloading articles, slow Internet connection and insufficient support for reference librarians.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Implications</em>
					-The findings will serve as a reference point for other university libraries considering offering digital reference service. 
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Originality</em>
					-This is an original research study. This study is the first of its kind in the study area.

					<strong>Abstract</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Rationale of Study</em>
					-The purpose of this paper is to identify and empirically assess the role of ICTs in enhancing knowledge management initiatives in Kenyan universities as a means to achieve institutional sustainability. The study assesses the knowledge management processes, identifies the ICT tools and technologies in use to enhance knowledge management of students’ information; and proposes a framework for the integration of ICTs in knowledge management.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Methodology</em>
					-This paper employed a quantitative research method using a descriptive approach, where one public and one private Kenyan university in Meru County were sampled. Using purposive sampling, an online questionnaire was used for data collection from staff within faculty, academic registrar, ICT, students’ finance, and library departments. The response rate was 75%. Descriptive statistics techniques were used to analyse the data.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Findings</em>
					-The study revealed that universities have invested in ICT tools and technologies to support knowledge management processes. However, they have not reaped full benefits due to their underutilisation. The results indicated that the institutions can achieve competitiveness, efficiency and effectiveness and improved decision making through full utilisation of these ICT tools and technologies.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Implications</em>
					-This research contributes to the need for ICT utilisation in knowledge management processes to enhance institutional sustainability through competitiveness, improved decision making, efficiency and effectiveness within the higher education sector.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Originality</em>
					-This is an original and empirical study conducted in two universities in Kenya.

					<strong>Abstract</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Rationale of Study</em>
					-The study was guided by four research questions which are: what are the automated services rendered in university libraries in South-South Nigeria?  What criteria do librarians use in the selection of automation software in university libraries? What are the automation software packages used by librarians in university libraries? To what extent do librarians in university libraries use automation software?
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Methodology</em>
					-This study adopted a descriptive survey design. The population of the study was 172 librarians from 10 university libraries that use automation software in South-South, Nigeria. The instrument for data collection was a questionnaire. Frequencies and statistical mean (with the criterion mean placed at 2.50) were used to answer the research questions.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Findings</em>
					-The findings of the study revealed that the automated services rendered in university libraries in South-South, Nigeria are cataloguing, circulation, and reference services. Librarians consider cost, vendor credibility, system management, support and maintenance, software reliability, functionality and user friendliness when selecting automation software for use in university libraries. KOHA, Strategic Library Automation Management, New Generation Library, and Alexandria are the software packages being used in university libraries in South-South, Nigeria, although the extent of usage is low.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Implications</em>
					-The findings from this study can act as a guide to library management in drawing out the criteria for consideration for selecting automation software.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Originality</em>
					-The study was an original research conducted on the selection criteria and usage of automation software in university libraries in South-South, Nigeria.

					<strong>Abstract</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Rationale of Study</em>
					-The emergence of a knowledge society driven by ubiquitous information and Information Communication Technology (ICT) has made knowledge to become the key resource facilitating the creation of new economic and social configurations. The challenge of managing abundant information available far and wide in a knowledge society finds most people unequipped with appropriate knowledge and skills. This, therefore, requires information literacy skills to cope with the challenge. The paper examines the provision of library services towards the improvement of information literacy in emerging knowledge society.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Methodology</em>
					-This study conducted a systematic literature review using classical approach. It explores scholarly databases including Google Scholar, ERIC, Science Direct and other institutional databases for literature search. Systematic search was carried out with key-word and title search synthesis in order to select and review the existing literature.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Findings</em>
					-Findings indicate that information literacy being a strong pillar of a knowledge society is central to educational and national developments. Hence, quality information literacy curricula and improved information literacy service by academic libraries. Also, library well-funded with modern ICT tools and information experts have the potential to foster information literacy in knowledge society through their services.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Implications</em>
					-The findings of study would enable stakeholders in education sector and other related agencies to support libraries objectives in imparting information literacy education by formulating educational policies that give room for information literacy education, review information literacy curricula for academic libraries, as well as support library at all levels with funds to run information literacy initiatives and programmes. 
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4"> 
					<em>Originality</em>
					-This is a conceptual review paper where scholarly literature on provision of library services for quality information literacy in Nigerian academic libraries were systematically analysed and relevant cited headings adopted.
