					<strong>Abstract</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Rationale of Study</em>
					-There are several pieces of unreliable information on the spread of the virus COVID-19. This leads to misconception on the existence and spread of the virus. It also affects the attitude of people, most especially the rural dwellers. This study investigates COVID-19 spread acceptability, attitude and information accessibility in a rural community in Delta State, Nigeria. 
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4"> 
					<em>Methodology</em>
					-The study adopted a descriptive survey design. The population for the study was 145,045. A sample of 0.1% of the population was used for analysis. Data was collected using questionnaires. The questionnaires were purposively administered to the sampled respondents in the homes of the ten (10) villages in Uvwie local government area in Effurun, Delta State, Nigeria. 
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Findings</em>
					-The study found that people no longer accept information on the existence and spread of the virus. This is because available information regarding the spread of the virus is either fake or unreliable. Consequently, individuals no longer see the need to adhere to the measures put in place to stop the spread of the virus.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Implications</em>
					-The study recommends an awareness campaign to be conducted on the spread of the virus in the rural communities. It also emphasises an altruist verification of all information concerning the virus as it will help to change the attitude of the populace.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Originality</em>
					-The manuscript is part of our recent study which was informed by the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, and has not been submitted for evaluation on the purpose of publication in journal.

					<strong>Abstract</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Rationale of Study</em>
					-COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that has resulted in an outbreak of viral pneumonia around the world. The total case has reached 3,581,783 (shared 78.5%) with 102,201 (84.4%) total deaths and 3,214,512 (78.7%) recoveries in the top 10 infected African countries as of April 28, 2021 at 10:30 am. This study models and forecasts COVID-19 new cases in the top 10 infected African countries from February 14 to September 06, 2020.  
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Methodology</em>
					-The COVID-19 new cases data was modelled and forecasted using curve estimation regression model and time series model from February 14 to September 6, 2020. 
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Findings</em>
					-The cubic regression models for the data were relatively the best fit for Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, and South Africa. The quadratic regression models for the data were the best fit for Cameroon, Cote dʹIvoire, and Ghana. The Algerian data was followed by the logarithmic regression model. In the time series analysis, the Algeria, Egypt, and South Africa COVID-19 new cases data have fitted the ARIMA (0,1,0), ARIMA (0,1,0), and ARIMA (0,1,14) models, respectively. The Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana and Nigeria data have fitted the simple exponential smoothing models. Ethiopia, Kenya, and Morocco data have followed the Damped trend, Holt, and Brown exponential smoothing models, respectively.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Implications</em>
					-The findings of the study may be used for preparedness planning against further spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in African countries. The author recommends that as many countries continue to relax restrictions on movement and mass gatherings, and more are opening of their air spaces and other sectors, strong and appropriate public health and social measures must be instituted to prevent further spread of the virus.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Originality</em>
					-The paper contributes a model which can be used to predict occurrence of new COVID-19 cases in top 10 infected African countries.

					<strong>Abstract</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Rationale of Study</em>
					-The purpose of this paper is to discuss the role of institutional repositories in supporting teaching, learning and research in four selected universities in Kenya. 
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Methodology</em>
					-Mixed methods research approach and a multiple case design was used for this study. Data was collected using questionnaires administered to 370 students and 322 academic staff randomly in the four universities in Kenya. Face to face interviews were used to collect data from the university librarians, system librarians and research directors in these universities.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Findings</em>
					-The study revealed that content in the selected institutional repositories was dominated by grey literature and was found to be inadequate, sometimes outdated and of poor quality. The findings also showed that although IRs in the selected universities contained many types of material covering many subjects, each specific subject area contained only a few materials. In addition, the results indicated that the rate of content recruitment in the selected IRs was very low.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Implications</em>
					-The findings of this study can contribute to discussions about the reasons for poor content recruitment in IRs and used to develop an appropriate model; it is expected that staff will deposit their scholarly content in institutional repositories more readily.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Originality</em>
					- Little has been documented on the effectiveness of content recruitment in institutional repositories in Kenyan universities. Therefore, this paper is a valuable addition to the existing literature on the subject.
