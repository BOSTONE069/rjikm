					<strong>Abstract</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Rationale of Study</em>
					-Successful implementation of today’s government operations requires effective policy
                    making and system monitoring through relevant data and information. E-government offers an increased
                    portfolio of public services in a cost-effective and efficient manner hence enabling governments to reinvent
                    the ways through which they interact with citizens, private sector, employees and other stakeholders.
                    Consequently, many countries have invested significant resources into collecting, processing, integrating,
                    analysing and reporting data through information and communication technologies (ICTs). The aim of this
                    paper is to review the status of e-government implementation in Kenya.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Methodology</em>
					-In order to measure the status of e-government, two indexes were used: 1) E-government
                    Development Index (EGDI); and 2) Network Readiness Index (NRI). The study adopted a theoretical approach
                    by conducting a review of literature on e-government in Kenya. Fit-Viability theory was used to assess the
                    capacity of the Government of Kenya to roll out viable e-services to its citizens. 
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Findings</em>
					-The findings indicate that Kenya has made significant progress in e-government implementation.
                    The benefits of e-government implementation in Kenya currently include enhanced e-participation,
                    accountability, planning, monitoring and information sharing. However, challenges such as inadequate
                    infrastructure, policy and human capital development hamper the effectiveness of e-government projects in
                    Kenya. These challenges may be surmounted through increased digital inclusivity, enhanced broadband
                    connectivity, strengthened staff ICT skills and openness to new technologies.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4"> 
					<em>Implications</em>
					-The findings of this study may be used by the Government of Kenya to plan, roll out and monitor
                    e-government projects with a view to enhancing their success and impact..
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Originality</em>
					-A number of studies on e-government in Kenya exist. Their focus has been on the factors affecting
                    the effective implementation of e-government in Kenya. Periodical assessment of the status of the projects is
                    lacking. This study seeks to fill this gap.

					Indigenous Knowledge in Acholi Nicknames
				</h3>

					<strong>Abstract</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Rationale of Study</em>
					-Nicknames are a cultural experience. In some contexts, they are perceived as ‘little’ names
                    that are different from ‘official’ names. Therefore, a nickname is a part of personal identity. Nicknames are
                    often discreet and sometimes opaque. This article explains the meaning of a nickname in the African context
                    and specifically discusses Acholi nicknames (mwoch) as an indigenous way of generating, sharing and
                    preserving knowledge.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Methodology</em>
					-Data for this paper was obtained through interviews. The author interviewed purposively
                    selected respondents from Mucwini in Kitgum and other parts of Acholi sub-region in northern Uganda. It is
                    the nicknames that were the subject of these interviews that are presented, analysed and discussed in this
                    article. The author also tapped into his childhood experience and knowledge of Acholi culture.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Findings</em>
					-Overall Acholi nicknames communicate indigenous knowledge but they must be unlocked,
                    deconstructed and explained in detail in order to share their meanings with the wider world in time and space.
                    It is writing and publication that holds a promise of conserving the knowledge so easily lost because it is
                    considered casual, trivial and peripheral to the core of cultures.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Implications</em>
					-The findings of this study may be used to demonstrate the power of cultural practices, such as
                    nicknames, to generate, share and preserve indigenous knowledge. They may also be used by governments
                    and cultural institutions to mainstream indigenous knowledge in the preservation of the universe of
                    knowledge in communities.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Originality</em>
					-There is limited literature on African nicknames. This article adds an East African tone to ongoing
                    discourse on names and nicknames by non-onomastics scholars who view nicknames as a form of indigenous
                    expression and communication that is deeply rooted in knowledge and philosophy. If not elucidated, the
                    knowledge remains hidden from scholars, and thus unproductive to creativity and eventually lost to all.
