					Mobilisation and Use of Alternative Funds by University Libraries in Nigeria

					<strong>Abstract</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Rationale of Study</em>
					-This paper investigated the level to which funds raised are used in solving financial problems in university libraries in Nigeria.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Methodology</em>
					-The study employed a descriptive survey to investigate fundraising in university libraries in Nigeria. The population of the study consisted of eleven (11) heads of university libraries in South-South geo-political zone in Nigeria. The entire population was used for the study. Data was collected through structured questionnaires. Data analysis was done using descriptive statistics.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Findings</em>
					-The study revealed that fundraising is necessary in university libraries because the institutions have limited options of coping with financial stress. The study concluded that there should be intensive effort to intensify fundraising efforts by university librarians. Librarians also need to utilise a wide array of fundraising approaches. There is also need for an appropriate structure to facilitate successful and well-organised fundraising efforts by libraries.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4"> 
					<em>Implications</em>
					-Based on the findings, the researchers recommend that LIS schools and professional associations should organise sensitisation or orientation programmes on entrepreneurship development in order to re-write the perception of library staff towards entrepreneurship.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Originality</em>
					-Alternative sources of funds in libraries have become necessary in the face of meagre funding from the government against increasing expectations on the part of the university libraries. Also, there should be a concerted effort to embrace other unexploited means of fundraising by librarians.

					<strong>Abstract</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Rationale of Study</em>
					-The purpose of this study was to investigate how extension service providers employed ICTs in transforming agricultural extension information service delivery in Tana River County, Kenya. The study examined how the application of ICTs can help to transform public extension service delivery thereby improving the farmers’ access to agricultural information.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Methodology</em>
					-Data was collected from 456 farmers in Tana River County in Kenya. The farmers were identified using simple random sampling. Data was collected using structured questionnaires and interview guides. Data analysis was performed using simple descriptive statistics.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Findings</em>
					-The findings revealed that there was limited application of ICTs in the dissemination of agricultural extension information in Tana River County, Kenya. However, where application was prominent, an increase in productivity was noted.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Implications</em>
					-The findings of this study may be used by the County Government of Tana River and the national Government of Kenya to improve agricultural productivity in the country through improved extension services.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Originality</em>
					-The study was an original research conducted in a remote food-insecure county in Kenya. It links agricultural productivity to effective access to extension information services supported by ICTs.

					<strong>Abstract</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Rationale of Study</em>
					-The study investigated collection development models in academic libraries in South-South, Nigeria.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Methodology</em>
					-This study was designed as a descriptive survey. The population consisted of 30 academic collection development librarians purposively sampled from academic libraries in SouthSouth, Nigeria. The instrument for data collection was a 3-point scale (Agreed- 3, Undecided- 2 and Disagree- 1) questionnaire. Out of the 30 questionnaires administered to respondents, 27 were retrieved and used for the study. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Findings</em>
					-The study revealed that the main method for developing academic library collections was through purchase; respondents have adequate knowledge of “just-in-case” and “just-in-time” models of collection development; and that a majority of the respondents use the “just-in-time” model in building their library collections.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Implications</em>
					-As a result of insufficient funds to address purchase of library resources and embark on just-in-case model, chief librarians must advance and put forward fund raising strategies to circumvent government inability to provide funds adequately.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Originality</em>
					-To best knowledge of the author, this study is the first of its kind in investigating the application of “just-in-case” and “just-in-time” collection development methods in academic libraries in South-South Nigeria.
