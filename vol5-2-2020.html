					<strong>Abstract</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Rationale of Study</em>
					-This paper highlights the usefulness of mentoring in sustaining
                    professionalism among academic librarians in Nigeria. The paper identifies who a
                    librarian is, the cardinal elements of a profession, the code of ethics of
                    librarianship and why it is important for librarians to follow the rules and
                    regulations of the profession.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Methodology</em>
					-A quantitative research design was selected for this study to
                    investigate the views of librarians on mentoring for sustaining professionalism in
                    Nigerian academic libraries. The study used questionnaires to collect data which
                    was analysed quantitatively. 
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Findings</em>
					-The key findings showed that majority of the respondents are into one
                    form of mentoring. Results also showed that there are benefits in mentoring and
                    it should be encouraged and sustained for professional development. The paper
                    concludes that mentoring is a tool needed for building future librarians and
                    required for taking the profession to its expected destination.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4"> 
					<em>Implications</em>
					-The results of the study will help librarians and library associations to
                    appreciation and encourage mentoring in the profession and do all to sustain
                    professionalism through mentoring.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Originality</em>
					-The paper’s contribution to knowledge lies in its evidence to support
                    the position that librarians need mentoring to facilitate productivity and
                    professionalism in academic libraries.

					<strong>Abstract</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Rationale of Study</em>
					-This study investigated the adoption of Web 2.0 tools to
                    promote library services and resources in university libraries in South-South,
                    Nigeria.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Methodology</em>
					-The study adopted a descriptive survey design. The population of
                    the study was 164 librarians in university libraries that use Web 2.0. These
                    university libraries were identified by physical visit as well as searching their Web
                    2.0 presence online. The total enumeration sampling technique was used for the
                    study due to the manageable size of the population. Data was collected using
                    questionnaires. Descriptive statistics was used to analyse the data collected.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Findings</em>
					-The study showed that the major Web 2.0 tools used by librarians to
                    promote library services and resources are Facebook, Whatsapp, Instagram and
                    Twitter. LinkedIn, Google+, YouTube, Snapchat, Skype, wikis, and blogs are
                    used minimally. The findings revealed that the services librarians are promoting
                    using the Web 2.0 tools are user education, research help services, reference
                    services, extension and outreach services, selective dissemination of information,
                    announcement, loan services, and book reservation. The challenges affecting the
                    use of Web 2.0 in university libraries include lack of policy on the use of Web 2.0,
                    erratic power supply, and inadequate Internet infrastructure.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Implications</em>
					-The findings of this study can be used by university libraries to
                    develop promotional services using Web 2.0 tools.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">

					<strong>Abstract</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Rationale of Study</em>
					-The purpose of this ICTs, knowledge management, students’ information, Universities, sustainability, Kenyastudy was to find out whether academics in
                    the Faculty of Communication and Information Science, National University of
                    Science and Technology (NUST), Zimbabwe freely share academic knowledge.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Methodology</em>
					-The study adopted a descriptive survey design. Using a census
                    method, a questionnaire was administered to 55 academics in the faculty. Data
                    collected was analysed using Microsoft Excel, frequency count and simple
                    percentages.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Findings</em>
					-The results indicate that academics in the faculty are aware of the
                    importance of sharing knowledge but they do not share it frequently as and when
                    it is necessary; NUST creates an environment for knowledge sharing though the
                    Internet is not reliable for easy access of online digital resources, connectivity and
                    flow of knowledge; academics require knowledge for postgraduate supervision,
                    writing grant proposals.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Implications</em>
					-This paper can be used as a stepping stone to develop an
                    institutionalised written university knowledge management policy to help set
                    standards and initialise the knowledge sharing and transfer in the Faculty of
                    Communication and Information Science at NUST.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Originality</em>
					-This empirical study will contribute to the theoretical knowledge on
                    knowledge sharing in the higher education sector, which has been neglected in
                    universities. It also contributes to knowledge on KM in the institutions of higher
                    learning.

				<p>
					<strong>Abstract</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Rationale of Study</em>
					-The purpose of this study was to examine the utilisation of
                    library and information services in the Judiciary of Uganda. It was based on the
                    premise that if library and information services in the Judiciary of Uganda are well
                    utilised, effective administration of justice in Uganda would be achieved.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Methodology</em>
					-The study was guided by Saracevic-Kantor theory of use-oriented
                    value of library and information services. Participants were drawn from two (2)
                    selected libraries namely, the High Court (criminal division) and the Supreme
                    Court libraries. These are the oldest and have the biggest collection compared to
                    the rest of the judiciary libraries. Given a population of five (5) librarians (2 from
                    Supreme court library and 3 from the High Court library), interviews were held
                    with four (4) librarians, two from each of the libraries.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Findings</em>
					-The study established that both the High Court and Supreme Court
                    libraries provide a wide range of services including current awareness, referral,
                    research, selective dissemination of information, Internet, photocopying and
                    newspaper clipping services. The services were regularly utilised across the
                    libraries. However, only 47% of the users were very satisfied with the services,
                    followed by 31% that were satisfied. Some of the challenges affecting the
                    utilisation of library and information services in the Judiciary of Uganda include
                    poor Internet connectivity, inadequate current information, insufficient funding,
                    and limited library facilities.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Implications</em>
					-This study recommends strengthening of library and information
                    services across the Judiciary by digitising the information resources, system-wide
                    automation, training of library users, improving Internet connectivity, increasing
                    funding for library services, and formulation and implementation of a Judiciary of
                    Uganda library policy.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Originality</em>
					-This study is an addition to the scanty literature about judiciary library
                    services, most especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The study ascertains the need for
                    strengthening library and information services in judiciaries.

					A meta-Analytical Review of the Role
of Indigenous Knowledge on
Environmental Conservation and
Climate Change in Kenya
				</h3>

				<p>
					<strong>Abstract</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Rationale of Study</em>
					-This paper examines how indigenous environmental knowledge
                    (IEK) can be applied in the conservation and management of natural resources in
                    Kenya. It also explores how IEK can be captured, coded, stored and integrated
                    into climate studies and conservation efforts.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Methodology</em>
					-Due to the lack of consensus on the nature of IEK whether
                    ecosystem management, stewardship, natural resource management or
                    environmental conservation practices, the study used a meta-analytical approach
                    to review scientific publications, papers and published journals in order to
                    develop an overarching framework that would guide the capture, documentation,
                    repositing and archiving of the local IEK. The integration of indigenous
                    knowledge systems into mainstream knowledge offers great potential in
                    strengthening socio-ecological resilience.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Findings</em>
					-The study identified several themes that include environmental
                    stewardship, natural resource management, environmental conservation practises
                    among others that relate to the IEK resources, its effectiveness on environmental
                    management and the integration of IEK into climate change. The findings show
                    that IEK has been applied in environmental conservations efforts in several
                    countries such as the traditional resource usage models, the rain-making tradition
                    of the Luhya Community, resource conservation practices of the Maasai among
                    other practises. The study concludes that IEK can be drawn from several
                    indigenous communities in Kenya that include, the Maasai, Sengwer, Pokot,
                    Samburu among others and with the aid of the information science discipline
                    which leads to the development of an IEK repository in Kenya.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Implications</em>
					-The study recommends that national institutions in Kenya such as
                    Kenya Forestry Research Institute, Kenya Forest Service, and Kenya Wildlife
                    Service be involved in the search for alternative solutions to climate change
                    concerns.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4"> 
					<em>Originality</em>
					-The study is advocating for the formalization and mainstreaming of
                    the communal IEK among the communities in Kenya.
