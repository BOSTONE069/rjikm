					The factors determining knowledge sharing intention among information professionals in Nigeria
				</h3>

					<strong>Abstract</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Rationale of Study</em>
					-Several studies have considered the factors determining the knowledge sharing intention among employees. However, studies focusing on information professionals and  factors determining their knowledge sharing intention through a path model are either limited or been ignored.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Methodology</em>
					- In this study, the researcher developed and tested a path model that explains the factors that determine the intention of information professionals in Nigeria to share knowledge with their colleagues through a survey design.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Findings</em>
					-The results revealed that a correlation exists between the overall knowledge sharing intention score and the other knowledge sharing intention factors. The results demonstrate that citizenship behaviour had the highest correlation with knowledge sharing intention (r = 0.852). This is followed by creativity and innovation (r=0.704), and interaction frequency (r = 0.558). The results of the regression of knowledge sharing intention on the ten related factors show an adjusted R-square value of 0.661, and an F-ratio of 105.37; the latter of which is significant at 0.05 level (0.000 < 0.05). These indicate that the ten independent variables jointly (as indicated by the R-square value) explained 76.5% of the variations in the knowledge sharing intention by the information professionals.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Implications</em>
					-The research findings have a big bearing on policy formulation and decision making in information and knowledgeorganisations, the public and private information sector players, professional associations and information and knowledge training institutions. 
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Originality</em>
					-This research has a great value in the sense that it is one of the pioneer studies on information sharing in the context of information research in Nigeria.

					Knowledge Management Jobs in Kenya: A Functional Analysis

				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Abstract</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Rationale of Study</em>
					-Most organisations in Kenya face challenges integrating the knowledge management function in their structures due to the lack of a clear understanding of what knowledge managers should do. Consequently, there currently exist varied, unpredictable and often shallow job descriptions associated with knowledge managers.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4"> 
					<em>Methodology</em>
					-The researchers conducted a functional analysis of knowledge management jobs in Kenya in an effort to establish the general job titles used to refer to knowledge management specialists, ascertain their position in the organisational structure, explore their job responsibilities and requirements, as well as understand any special requirements associated with knowledge management roles. Data was obtained through a content analysis of job advertisements carried in the Daily Nation and Standard, which are the leading newspapers in Kenya,. Additional data was also obtained from online job advertisement platforms.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Findings</em>
					-Most organisations in Kenya do not have a good understanding of what knowledge management specialists do. Consequently, existing knowledge management positions have ambiguous and diverse job descriptions and requirements.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Implications</em>
					-The findings of this study can be used by organisations in Kenya to develop appropriate knowledge management job descriptions for knowledge management professionals. The findings may also be used by the relevant training institutions to develop and deploy relevant curricula to equip the
                    potential knowledge management professionals with the requisite skills.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Originality</em>
					-The researchers propose a model job description for knowledge management specialists which may be applied by organisations in Kenya and beyond.

					Distance librarianship in Kenyan Universities

					<strong>Abstract</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Rationale of Study</em>
					-Many institutions of higher learning in Kenya are now delivering their programmes through distance learning and the library is providing support by offering information resources and services to students who are off campus. This research sought to establish the effectiveness of libraries in providing information resources and services to open and distance learners ODLs.. 
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Findings</em>
					-The study found that academic libraries were generally effective in delivering services to ODLs. This was exemplified by the existence of institutional repositories where research papers were available to ODLs the majority of the students were trained on basic computer skills enabling them to use digital resources effectively as well as collaboration during information repackaging between faculty, ICT staff and ODL personnel.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Implications</em>
					-This paper highlights the role libraries can play to ODL university students, an aspect that can greatly influence information resource and service delivery. It makes a significant contribution to the distance librarianship practice and policy.
				</p>
				<p class="text-white-75 mb-4">
					<em>Originality</em>
					- Little has been documented on the effectiveness of content recruitment in institutional repositories in Kenyan universities. Therefore, this paper is a valuable addition to the existing literature on the subject.
